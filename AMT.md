# **Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk or AMT)**

**Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)** is a crowdsourcing platform where requesters post small digital tasks (HITs – Human Intelligence Tasks) that workers complete for pay. Common tasks include data labeling, surveys, transcription, and content moderation. While AMT offers flexible work, it also comes with risks like low pay, unfair rejections, and platform opacity, which make community knowledge and tools essential for success.

## Getting Started:

1. **Signing-up process:**   
   1. Create a Worker account  
   2. Be prepared to verify your identity (ID or tax info)  
   3. Wait for approval (can take days or weeks)  
   4. Set up a payment method via Amazon Payments to receive earnings.  
2. **Avoid Bad HITs** as they can over complicate your experience. Some tellings can include:  
   1. Vague instructions  
   2. Unclear qualifications  
   3. Too low price and/or too low time  
3. **Rules of thumb or productive/survival tips**:   
   1. **Keep track of hours and pay**: Always calculate hourly pay rate   
   2. **Use batching**: Do similar HITs together to reduce cognitive load  
   3. **Keep notes**: On requesters you liked/disliked, time estimates, common rejections for future HITs  
   4. **Screenshots**: Take them for unclear instructions or ambiguous responses—it helps in case of disputes  
   5. **Don’t overwork**: Mental burnout is real. Set session timers (e.g., 90 mins max, then break or pomodoro technique)

## Community Resources and Tools:

In “Becoming the Super Turker,” Professor Saiph Savage and her team demonstrate how novice crowd workers can increase their earnings on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) by adopting the strategies used by high-earning workers known as “Super Turkers.” These Super Turkers rely on transparency tools and community-shared information to navigate the platform more effectively. The research found that when novice workers followed a simple, widely used Super Turker criterion, such as prioritizing requesters with high ratings, they earned significantly better wages than those who did not. This study highlights the power of collective knowledge and transparency in improving outcomes for new workers, offering a practical and proven “winning formula” to boost earnings in the MTurk ecosystem.

Work only with requesters whose:

- “hourly pay” on TurkerView is over $8.29 USD/h (averaged from values that Super Turkers provided for this metric).  
- If such transparency data is unavailable:∗work only with requesters whose “fair”score on Turkop-ticon is over 3.69 (averaged).

- If such transparency data is unavailable:∗perform tasks with reward \> $0.23 USD (averaged.)

### *Resources to use:*

1.  [r/mturk](https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/wiki/index/) (Reddit Community) \- The r/mturk subreddit has a wiki and strategy guides on maximizing earnings.  
   1. More reddit communities:   
      1. The forum [TurkerNation](https://www.reddit.com/r/TurkerNation/) maintains a thread called "mTurk in the Media" where community members post and discuss papers and news stories published about mTurk, Turkers, and Turk work.  
   2. Key strategies discussed:  
      1. Using scripts and browser extensions (e.g., MTurk Suite, PandaCrazy)  
      2. Batch work prioritization  
      3. Identifying high-paying requesters  
      4. Avoiding low-wage HITs

2. [MTurkCrowd](https://www.mturkcrowd.com/) Forum \- Community discussions and tutorials on becoming an efficient worker.  
   1. Focus on tracking high-paying HITs and optimizing time spent on tasks.   
   2. This [thread](https://www.mturkcrowd.com/threads/your-first-1000-hits.23/) focusing on the first 1000 HITs will benefit you a lot considering it’s written by a moderator on MTurkCrowd and viewed over 180k times. This guide was written in 2016 so some, though not all, might be out of date.   
        
3. [Turkopticon](https://turkopticon.net/) \- Allows workers to rate and review requesters, ensuring they only accept well-paid and fair HITs.  
   1. One of the key Super Turker strategies is identifying high-paying requesters and avoiding low-paying tasks, which Turkopticon helps with.  
   2. Get into the habit of checking reviews early on in your turking career.

4. [PandaCrazy](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pandacrazy-max/gefompgkggmjbcihdkdbfddhjnnceipm?hl=en-US) \- HIT-capturing tool that automates batch work, a key finding in the Super Turker research.  
   1. Helps workers grab high-paying HITs before they disappear.  
   2. Page refreshing is predominantly used to grab HITs that are in high demand. The use of rapid page refreshing for this purpose is known as PandA, short for "preview and accept."  
   3. Instructions on how to use Panda or customize your search can be found [here](https://github.com/JohnnyRS/PandaCrazy-Max).

5. [Turkerview](https://turkerview.com/) \- TurkerView is another transparency tool that allows workers to visualize requesters’ reputations and offers metrics that are similar to Turkopticon.   
   1. Differences between TurkerView and Turkopticon   
      1. Not open source: predicts how a requester will behave based on their interactions with workers who are using Turkerview  
      2. Predict hourly wage: Not exact per task but provides an overall picture of how that requester operates  
   2. Helps workers make informed decisions on which tasks are worth their time.
