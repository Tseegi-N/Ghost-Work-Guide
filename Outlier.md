# **Outlier**

Outlier is a crowd work platform that connects subject-matter experts to improve Generative AI systems. Common tasks include generating or ranking prompts, refining AI-generated responses, and other annotation tasks to enhance model training and performance. Compared to older platforms like MTurk, Outlier is relatively new and closely tied to the development of AI products, which brings both opportunity and ethical concerns. While Outlier is a legitimate company, it has received mixed reviews from its users. Some contributors have praised the flexible opportunities and competitive pay, while others report frustrating glitches, inconsistent communication, unexplained pay changes, and a lack of clear task expectations.

## Getting Started:

1. **Signing-up process:**   
   1. Initial sign-up needs verifying information, such as:  
      1. A valid ID and mobile phone from your country of residence.  
      2. An up-to-date resume that highlights your expertise.  
      3. A LinkedIn profile showing your educational background and work experience.  
   2. Once you're registered, you'll apply to projects that typically have two main stages:  
      1. Qualification stage: Before earning money, you must qualify for projects by reviewing guidelines and completing unpaid assessment tasks. These are used to evaluate your performance and determine eligibility for the paid portion of the work. (Many workers report frustration about the amount of unpaid time spent during this stage.)  
      2. Tasking stage, where you can work on deliverable tasks and start earning money.  
   3. Payments are processed weekly on Tuesdays, covering tasks completed during the previous pay period (Tuesday to Monday at midnight UTC).  
      1. Payments are made via PayPal, AirTM, or ACH transfer.

2. **Don’t leave the window\!** If you switch tabs or close the task page, your time may not be counted. Consider using another device (e.g., a phone or tablet) for external research to avoid disrupting the work session.
