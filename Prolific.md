# **Prolific**

Prolific is a UK-based platform that connects researchers with a global pool of participants. It’s widely considered to be more ethical and better-paying than other survey platforms, but it still faces problems, including but not limited to, data privacy, unexplained rejections, and vague/exploitative terms of service. 

## Getting Started:

1. **Signing-up process**:  
   1. Initial sign-up: Create an account and complete the About You section in full. Try to go into detail as much as possible since this determines which studies you qualify for.  
   2. Approval: Some accounts may be waitlisted so join early and check frequently.  
   3. Set up a payment method via Paypal to receive earnings.  
2. **Update profiles often**: More completed demographic questions \= more matches to studies.  
3. **Avoid Bad jobs** as they can over complicate your experience. Some tellings can include:  
   1. Vague instructions  
   2. Unclear qualifications  
   3. Too low price and/or too low time

## Community Resources & Tools:

1. **Choosing studies**: From online discussions on Prolific, it’s understood that best Prolific studies have (this is not official or supported by studies):  
   1. Estimated pay rate ≥ $8–$10/hr  
   2. Honest time estimates  
   3. Clear instructions  
   4. No deceptive attention checks  
2. **Avoid rejection**  
   1. Always read instructions carefully  
   2. Complete in one sitting if possible  
   3. Message researchers if you hit tech issues—they're often understanding
