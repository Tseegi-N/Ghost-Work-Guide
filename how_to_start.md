## Where do I even start?

It’s a great question because honestly, onboarding for most platforms is a pain. From my experience and lots of Reddit threads, signing up can mean:
- Uploading legal IDs
- Downloading extra apps to verify your device
- Creating detailed “worker profiles” or passing unpaid skills tests
- Waiting days or weeks with no response

I've tried about 10 platforms. Only two actually led to real paid work.

Many sites ask for *sensitive personal data*, so do your research before giving away your info. Look for platform reviews on [Reddit](http://reddit.com/), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/), or sites like [Fairwork](https://fair.work/). If you’d like to do your own research on the topic, check-out [r/beermoney](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/) subreddit, a community for people to discuss mostly online money-making opportunities. They have tons of megathreads on platform-specific discussions. 

## How to choose the right platform?

The best platform (for you) depends on:

1. Type of work (surveys? data labeling? tutoring?)  
2. Time commitment  
3. Your location (U.S.-based platforms often pay better)  
4. Your financial goal ($5/day vs $20/hr?)

Try searching something like:

"data entry, 10 hrs/week, remote, above $15/hr gig platform"

You’ll get a sense of which platforms are legit vs. sketchy real quick.
