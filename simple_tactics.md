## Simple tactics to follow

We’re focusing on the main 4 objectives that we’ve identified through scholarly analysis and an online survey conducted from Smith college students and beyond. A lot of the websites and apps suggested are only one of the many tools out there that are free, accessible, and helpful. I’m not advocating or advertising the use of these tools, and they’re mostly expendable. 

1. ### *Ensure Fair Compensation*

   1. Use platform review tools like [Turkopticon](https://turkopticon.net/) to check employer (requester) reputations before taking on tasks.  
   2. Track work hours and earnings using time-logging tools like [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) or [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to assess fair pay. There are more apps out there that I’m not familiar with, so please research and choose platforms that match your preference and needs.   
   3. Demand fair pay by joining worker advocacy groups like [Fairwork](https://fair.work/) or online worker communities (e.g., Reddit’s [r/beermoney](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/) or Discord groups for gig workers).

2. ### *Provide Mental Health Support*

   1. Set boundaries by scheduling breaks and using website blockers like [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) to avoid burnout. Again, there’s a lot more similar websites/apps out there, so please make sure to choose what works for you.  
   2. Find mental health resources through gig worker communities. Connect with fellow gig workers who’re going through the same experience. Reach out to college community sites (Confesh, IG, and more) to find and connect with ghost workers. 

3. ### *Clarify Employment Rights*

   1. Read platform terms carefully and document work to dispute unfair bans. \[plugin or app that helps with that?\]  
   2. Use online blogs ([GigWorkerRights](https://bizbot.com/blog/gig-worker-rights-comprehensive-guide-2024/)) to understand rights and keep it handy for any future disputes.  
   3. Join worker-led advocacy groups to push for better regulations. \[any specific ones?\]

4. ### *Enhance Transparency*

   1. Use Fairwork’s reports to choose ethical platforms. ([Fairwork](https://fair.work/))  
   2. Contribute to transparency efforts by leaving honest reviews on platforms like Turkopticon.  
   3. Engage in community discussions about unfair practices.

Currently, we’ve collected and prepared resource guides for three major crowdworking platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), Prolific, and Outlier. These platforms were selected based on their popularity, accessibility of information, and, most importantly, responses from an online survey conducted at Smith College as part of this semester-long project, where over 60% of participants reported experience with one or more of these platforms. If there’s a specific platform you’d like to see included, please don’t hesitate to reach out. This guide is intended to be a dynamic, evolving resource, and I’d love to collaborate in expanding it further.
