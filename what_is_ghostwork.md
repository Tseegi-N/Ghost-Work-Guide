## What is Ghostwork?

*“Ghost work”* refers to the invisible labor behind many tech services, things like content moderation, image tagging, data labeling, and even filtering disturbing videos, often done anonymously by people with no credit or recognition. Just like so many forms of exploitative labor throughout history, if something *doesn’t have a name*, it becomes easier to ignore and even easier to abuse. Ghost workers are frequently funneled through digital platforms with no to little wage guarantees, benefits, job protections, or real recourse when work gets rejected or goes unpaid, legal right to unionize or organize, and mental health advocacy.

Despite how critical they are to keeping AI systems and the internet running, these workers are largely invisible and that makes it easy for platforms to underpay, overwork, and forget them. This guide exists to help people (especially students) not fall into that same trap.

## Why we need a guide like this?

We believe ghost workers deserve more than invisibility. That’s why we focus on these four goals:
1. **Fair Pay**: Help folks understand how to recognize fair rates and avoid underpaid tasks.
2. **Mental Health Awareness**: Provide tips and resources for dealing with burnout, frustration, and harmful content.
3. **Know Your Rights**: Clarify the blurry lines of contractor vs. employee, and how to protect your data.
4. **Transparency & Tools**: Introduce community-built resources that empower workers to make better choices.

This isn’t just a guide; it’s part of a larger push for a more equitable digital labor system, where gig workers have a voice, choices, and support.
